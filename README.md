## Problem(s)

Client (Gwinnett Pulmonary & Sleep) required a new front-end for their patient portal (originally in Athena EMR) to provide better user experience, add functionality, and improve SEO performance. In addition, the back-end workflow architecture needed to be simplified (multiple databases in Athena, Phreesia, and Klara not communicating with each other when booking an appointment) which required the IT staff to manually input and confirm appointment bookings (process maps shown below).
